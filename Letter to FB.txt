Anna Leffler, my maternal grandmother, used to sing us this Russian-Jewish counting-song that she'd learned in her native land, what is now Belarus. Recently my cousin, Margaret Schindel, and I were reminiscing about it; I decided to write down the music and what we could remember of the lyrics.

Unfortunately, there are significant gaps in the text. Can anyone suggest academic departments, religious or government organizations where that might have a record of this song?
